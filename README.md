This repository is a part of our ongoing efforts to design a Hybrid stochastic modeling description for SoS Architecture Modeling. 
It containts some initial prototypes of the fomral syntax termainl rules based on Hybrid Stochatic process algebra orignating from SPA and class Porcess Algebriac formlaism. 

The terminal rules have been defined considering underlying syntax and semantics. These are initial versions of the formal descrpitons. 
Further updates will be provided. 
Terminal rules have been defined using existing formal modeling  representations mainly classic pi calculus (Pi- ADL), Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS)
& CCP (Sosadl). The core Architectrual concepts are inspired from class formal Architecture descripitons aimed for single systems modeling.
